# ArtByBlind
ecommerce site

About this project: 

This is a project to create an ecommerce website for a school for blind adults in Khartoum, Sudan.

The school's mission is to empower blind adults by training them as artisans creating
jewelry, ceramics and other artistic endeavors.  These artisans want to be empowered 
to be earners in their community, not charity cases.

As of May 2018, this website has most of the basic functions and focuses on the jewelry 
that the artisans are already producing.

/* NOTE: The first student project team created this site and now the next group of 
students to take over will be enhancing the site to work better for the purposes of 
marketing and selling the art that the ArtByBlind Artisans create.

Original contributors to the website include:

A Blesener, A Cervantes, D Shell, I St. Martin and R Walczak. 
with advice from A Pulendran and P Merns

*/

The website uses PHP, MySQL and javascript as it's primary languages
